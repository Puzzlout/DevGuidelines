Always be sure that, after your last commit, the build is successful.
If not, you ***MUST*** fix the build.

# Codacy
While you code, you may not see all code style issues at first sight. That's what Codacy is there for.
Still, make sure you write clean code in the first place. Codacy will verify the rest.

# Code coverage
In tandem with Travis CI, Codecov extension allows to verify how much of the code is tested. 
Ideally, 100% is the target.
In practice, there may be cases hard to test. Be imaginative and ask for help.
